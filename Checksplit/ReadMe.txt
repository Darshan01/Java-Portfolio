Use this to split up the bill at a restaurant.
The first line is the number of guests attending
Then, on each line, include the guest's name, the word "birthday" if it is their birthday, how many items they ordered, then each item they ordered and its cost
After the guests, include the tax on a new line
After that, include the tip on a new line 
Look at example.txt and example split.txt to see an example

Use guests.in as your input
split.out will show you how much each person should contribute. Birthday people pay nothing.
